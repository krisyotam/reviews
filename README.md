## About Me
I am an autodidact and philomath with a deep passion for learning, particularly in mathematics, computer science, and technology. As someone who consumes a vast array of resources—books, articles, tutorials, videos, courses, and more—I understand the challenges of finding quality material that truly adds value to one's learning journey.

This space is my attempt to provide thoughtful reviews and share my personal opinions on the resources I've explored. Whether it's a well-known book or an obscure tutorial, I aim to offer honest insights to help others make informed decisions.

## Why Resource Reviews?
As a self-learner, I know how overwhelming it can be to sift through the massive amount of information available today. Some resources may be too advanced, others too basic, or simply not relevant to your specific goals. I've often wished for more curated recommendations—reviews from real learners who understand the practical aspects of absorbing new material.

My reviews reflect my own experiences with these resources, the pros and cons, and whether they delivered what they promised. It's important to note that a good review from me doesn't mean a resource will suit everyone, and a critical review doesn't mean you shouldn't explore it yourself. Learning is highly personal, and different materials work for different people.

## What to Expect
In this repository, you'll find reviews covering a wide range of topics, including:
- **Mathematics**: from foundational principles to advanced concepts  
- **Computer Science**: from beginner-friendly tutorials to in-depth guides  
- **Technology & Programming**: resources across various languages, frameworks, and tools

Each review includes my general thoughts on the resource, what I found useful, and any limitations. Where applicable, I'll also highlight the target audience and recommend alternatives.
